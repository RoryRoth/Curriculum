									<p>Some months ago, Facebook announce its name change to Meta, openly revealing their interest in developing part of the Metaverse. 
										But first, what is the Metaverse, well, beyond the philosophical matters and all that, the Metaverse is a blockchain-based digital 
										place where basically everything is possible, in there, the possibilities go from playing VR games to buy a digital land valued in 
										2.4 million dollars, that’s right, 2.4 million dollars</p>
								</div>
								<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
									<p> for a piece of land located on a 3D online game. Why would someone waste that amount of money on that? Well, is believed that the 
										Metaverse is the place where the opportunities are heading, real state, technology development and business development are just 
										some of the industries looking for a space in this new revolution.</p>

							<p>Now, how the Metaverse and the web technologies interact? In the first place, the web technologies have, for years, been the main source of 
								connection all around the world, the web has linked people, teams and even nations in its servers, and recently has hosted some of the heaviest 
								programs a computer can process; videogames. Google has created a tool called Stadia that allows any computer with any technic specifications can 
								play any game that is offered in its catalog, the same has done by NVIDIA, </p>
								<p>GeForce Now offer almost every high-consuming game that is available 
								for pc, and it can be played anywhere online in a browser. With the Metaverse incoming to the web, sooner or later, sooner rather than later, 
								all programs that are used in a computer and consume processing, memory or other resources will be accessible from any web browser that comes 
								with the huge possibility of being authenticated via blockchain technology.</p>
